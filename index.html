              For 25 years I had been a musician. During a gig in Japan I
              realized that I had lived the dream and it was time for something
              else. After a year of traveling I got to work in an office. All
              day we were copying and pasting data from one Excel-sheet to
              another. Interested in automating these digital drudgeries I
              started to learn some basic VBA... to discover a new passion:
              coding.<br />In May 2020 I joined an 11 week JavaScript bootcamp
              at Codaisseur.
